    <h1>Anika Prabhu</h1>
    <div id="bio">
    Hello! My name is Anika. I am 16 years old and a junior at North Creek High School. I was born on June 24, 2003 at 5 p.m. on a Tuesday. My hobbies include drawing, singing, arts and crafts and playing the piano. This summer of 2019, I joined the <a href = "https://hq.girlswhocode.com/login?redirectTo=%2F"> girls who code <a/> summer immersion program hosted by At&t at Redmond. I also have finished driverâ€™s ed. But, outside of my educational life and hobbies, I also love nature walks, drowning in my sorrows by listening to depressing music at 2 a.m. lying in my bed, and binge- watching Stranger Things.

    <h3>Funny memories</h3>
    <p> If you know me, you know that I'm a very clumsy and awkward person. So here's the story of the time my clumsiness got the best of me. One day I was riding my bike around my neighborhood like I normally would on a sunny afternoon.
    I rode all the way up to the top of a steep hill. I began riding down, super super fast and I was coming closer and closer to my house. But I didnt realize how close I actually was. I came way too close to my
  house and way to fast. I needed to brake really fast! The only problem was, I had just gotten out of my training wheels phase and advanced to a gear bike. I still hadn't figured out the brakes on my bike, so instead of pressing <thead>
    back wheel brakes, I pressed the front ones, which lifted up the back wheels over my head, sent my flipping through the air, causing me to come crashing down right on the concrete! My sister came rushing behind me, to help me I thought,
    but instead of lifting me up, she just stood there like an idiot, while I was bleeding out! Anyway, eventually my mom came outside and helped me up (finally)! And... thats my funny story.

    <h3>Meeting my best friend</h3>
    <p> It all started back in 7th grade. A super short girl with the frizziest hair I've ever seen, walked into my math class and sat next to me. She looked and acted like she had just escaped from the zoo. Everything was fine at first
      . Then she grabbed one of my pencils and stared at it. Her eyes went wide as she asked, "OOOOOOOHHH... what's this??!" Then she started dumping everything from my binder, on to my desk
      .I got very annoyed at this point, but eventully the bell rang and it was time to go home. "Finally I'm done with her torture", I thought. About 2 hours after school, I went to church for choir practice, and guess who I saw there? The same girl
    from my math class! She ran up to me and started talking random irrelevant crap! But, turns out talking random irrelevant crap was my thing, so we bonded over it, she told me her name, (it was sharon)
    , and we became friends. And that's the story of how I met my best friend.
    <h3>Successes/ Failures</h3>
    <p> Whenever I achieve or succeed in something, it is usually following the long chain of failures before it. For example, my entire family always goes to this concert by an indian band. They're not famous or anything, but they were getting pretty popular
      . Anyway, my mom always dreamed of getting me to be a part of that band... somehow. Time came for me when they hosted auditions for people to join the band. So, my mom signed me up. I practiced a song until I got it perfect
